	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
	  <p>The Optimistic Autistic is more than just an app. It is a blog, book and inspirational app to help inspire and inform parents and caregivers of special needs children. Our aim is to encourage others to not only keep their heads up but to share their stories, as we share ours.</p>
      <p>There is much to gain from sharing your story. Not only do you gain courage, but you also strengthen others with your story. </p>
      <p>As a parent of an Autistic child, I know that it can be a lonely and trying time for not only the parents, but the entire family. I also know that I wouldn't trade the experience of raising our Jordan for nothing in the world.</p>
      <p>Check out our app. We encourage you to check out our blog at: <a href="http://www.optimisticautistic.com">http://www.optimisticautistic.com</a> and to read our testimony: <a href="http://www.blackbirddetectiveseries.com/optimisticautistic.html">The Optimistic Autistic: Our Testimony</a></p>

      <p>Speak only words that uplift.</p>

		<h1>Tips for Stressed Parents</h1>

	<div data-role="content">
	  <p>Here you will find tips to make your day easier. <br />
	    <br />
	    <strong>Doctor Appointments</strong><br />
	    <br />
	    When scheduling doctor appointments make sure to inform the receptionist of any foreseeable issues (e.g. need to be in a quiet area, morning or afternoon preferences, anything that will make it easier on your child during their visit).</p>
      <p><strong>Be your own advocate</strong><br />
        <br />
        Advocates are useful to those who do not understand Special Education law and procedures. While some parents are well versed in Special Education law and can move through the process with ease, many are not so lucky. Special Education is quite complicated. Many times an advocate will save you heartache and headache.<br />
  <br />
        There are many people out there willing to help parents and special needs students, however locating these people may be a trying task. As a parent who struggled with locating support from outside of our home, I would suggest that you start at home. </p>
